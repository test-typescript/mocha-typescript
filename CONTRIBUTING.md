## Useful Commands

### Run Tests For a Specific Package

```
> npm test -- --scope=@testdeck/core
```

### Clean Working Directory

To get rid of all the generated code, the installed packages and so on,
use the following command.

```
> git clean -f -X -d
```

This will delete all files and directories that are listed in .gitignore.

See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean for more information.
