Jest tests in OOP style!

```TypeScript
import { suite, test } from "@testdeck/jest";

@suite
class Hello {
  
  @test
  world() {
    expect(false).toBe(true);
  }
}
```

With support for

- test suite inheritance by either extension or mixins
- individual naming of both suites and tests
- parameterised tests

and more...

If you are looking for other test framework support, please see the following packages

- [@testdeck/jasmine](https://npmjs.com/package/@testdeck/jasmine)
- [@testdeck/mocha](https://npmjs.com/package/@testdeck/mocha)
